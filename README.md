# Sarah's MyReads React App 

The 6th project in the front-end web development nanodegree focusing on building a book/reading tracker app using
ReactJS

## Installing the App and Launching it

1. Clone the app's repository or Download the app's repository (code)'s zip folder.
2. Run npm install on the command line or git bash to install all dependencies crucial for the app to work.
3. Run npm start on the command line or git bash to launch this marvelous app (mediocre, but let me have this one). 
               **I hope you enjoy digging into it and stay tuned for improvements**
